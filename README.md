# Multithreaded Cpp to count word Occurences into 2 given files at current working directory.
## Under construction

This program reads two files given as input, by creating 2 threads that:

  - Read the files.
  - Count the occurences of each word.
  - Save the results in the cache.

And then creates a 3rd thread that prints the results int the following format:

  - TotalOccurences Word = OccFile1 + OccFile2
